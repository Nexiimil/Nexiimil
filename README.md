# Hi, I’m @Nexiimil
- 👀 I’m interested in a whole ton of languages, although right now I'm apparently looking into Minecraft add-on creation for Bedrock Edition as part of my masters course at Royal Holloway  
I'm largely familiar with Object-Oriented Languages, with Java and C# being my most loved languages, but I can easily work in Python as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a ton about allowing for modding APIs in any game, as well as some web-based RESTful API stuff too
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with businesses, largely just called 'work' (I'm looking for a job, in any language really, I'm quite a fast learner)
- 📫 How to reach me, if you need to:
