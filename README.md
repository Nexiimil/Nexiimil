# Hi, I’m Suli, or @Nexiimil online
- 👀 I’m interested in a whole ton of languages, but right now I'm a C# product developer associate gunning for mid-level at Epicor. I have active projects in Java and C#, one of which is the creation of a custom predicate based language to enable randomized selection.
I'm largely familiar with Object-Oriented Languages, with Java and C# being my most loved languages, but I can easily work in Python as well, I've even taught it to undergrads for a couple years.

 - I do have a couple of hidden repos as a result of my status as former student and staff at Royal Holloway. These repos contain large parts or entire works from university, which means other students may utilise my repos to plagiarise their way through, and I wouldn't wish to be part of that. If you are an employer, please do ask, and I can reveal these repos to you. The details of these hidden repos can be found in the projects section of my LinkedIn page.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about allowing for modding APIs in any game, as well as some web-based RESTful API stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with businesses, largely just called 'work' (I'm looking for a job, in any language really, I'm quite a fast learner).
