# Hi, I’m @Nexiimil
- 👀 I’m interested in a whole ton of languages. However, right now I'm apparently looking into Minecraft add-on creation for Bedrock Edition as part of my masters course at Royal Holloway, using JS and JSON.  
I'm largely familiar with Object-Oriented Languages, with Java and C# being my most loved languages, but I can easily work in Python as well.
I do have a couple of hidden repos as a result of my status as a current student at Royal Holloway. The reuse of the coursework from which these repos have been devised means other students may utilise my repos to plagiarise or cheat their way through University, and I wouldn't wish to be part of that. If you are an employer, please do ask, and I can reveal to you these repos. The details of these hidden repos can be found in the projects section of my LinkedIn page.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about allowing for modding APIs in any game, as well as some web-based RESTful API stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with businesses, largely just called 'work' (I'm looking for a job, in any language really, I'm quite a fast learner).
